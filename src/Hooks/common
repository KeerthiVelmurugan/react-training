| ✅ Hook        | 📌 “Management role”                                  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `useState`    | Stores **component-local state**                      |
| `useEffect`   | Runs & cleans up **side effects**                     |
| `useContext`  | Shares **global data**                                |
| `useRef`      | Manages **DOM refs & persistent non-reactive values** |
| `useCallback` | Manages **function re-creation** (performance)        |
| `useMemo`     | Manages **value recalculation** (performance)         |



🔍 Example: When to use what
👉 useState: counter, form field
👉 useEffect: fetch data from API when component mounts
👉 useContext: user login status for the whole app
👉 useRef: focus an input, store previous value
👉 useCallback: pass a stable function to child to prevent re-render
👉 useMemo: cache a slow calculation result (e.g., large list filter)

✅ One line summary
useState & useContext → State & data management

useEffect → Side-effect management

useRef → DOM and persistent mutable value

useCallback & useMemo → Performance optimizations
useReducer = state manager for complex logic, similar to Redux reducer pattern but local to a component.


useReducer is an alternative to useState for managing more complex state logic in React.

It’s inspired by Redux-style reducers:

You have a state

You have actions

You have a reducer function that decides how to update the state based on the action.
